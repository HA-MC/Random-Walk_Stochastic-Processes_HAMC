## ðŸ§® Â¿What is a random walk?  

A **Random Walk** is a stochastic process in which a value evolves in succesive random steps.  

ðŸ“Š It is used in :  
- **Finance** (model asset prices).  
- **Physics** (Brownian motion).  
- **Biology** (particle scattering).  
- **IA / Machine Learning** (simulating random environments).

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

### ðŸ”¹ Random Walk 1D

This 1D Random Walk generates a sequence of values where each element randomly increases, decreases, or remains the same relative to the prevoius one.

When graphed, the trajectory forms a wavy pattern, similar to the signals on an electrocardiogram, visually demonstrating the unpredictable nature of the stochastic process.

### ðŸ”¹ Random Walk 2D

This model simulates a random walk on a 2D plane, where at each step the position can change in any of four possible directions. The resulting trajectory is erratic and random, reminiscent of the Brownian motion particles in a fluid. This type of simulation allows the study of discrete stochastic processes and the observation of emergent patterns of random systems.

## Results and Conclusions

- 1D random walk simulations were performed with up to N user-defined steps.
- The results show that the final position can vary widely due to randomness.
- These simulations allow for the introduction of concepts of stochastic processes and probability theory.
